# Protests App
This is a project meant to be collaborated on by those learning the basics of React.js.

**Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute to this repository.**

Its purpose is, ostensibly, to allow the planning and execution of protests similar to other event planning software.

It will remain active and public.

The intended repository for the server side of this app is https://github.com/clevend2/protests-server.
